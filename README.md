# React-simple-app


Hi, this project is a simple react-redux app, that I've converted from Angular 2.
I've created it using 'create-react-app' which alowd me to start develop without having to configure Webpack, React etc.

In this React-redux project, I've tried to implement some functional programming code with the help 'RamdaJS' library. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the project you will have to install Node and NPM on your machin.

Ususally NPM come packaged with Node, so you probably only have to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You can check if Node is istalled by running the following in terminal or CMD in windows:

```
node -v
```
It should give you the version number. If you get as error, you probably don't have Node running on your machine.

If the test went well you can do the same to check NPM:

```
npm -v
```
### Installing

Download the project to your machine, or clone it using git to your prefered directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/ibaraness/React-simple-app.git
```

After that, in the same directory install all dependencies using

```
npm install
```
### Running the project

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
